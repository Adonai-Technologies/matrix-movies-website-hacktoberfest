# Hacktoberfest Summary

Hacktoberfest is an event on GitHub or GitLab that encourages everyone to participate in open source software development.  You are tasked with making **4 or more pull requests** during the month of October.  If your pull requests are accepted, then you win digital badges.  It's a chance to learn more about git, GitHub or GitLab, and in the case of this project, more about **web development, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.

3) **Open a Terminal**, where you can enter command line text. For the next steps, you'll be using this terminal.

4) **Clone the forked repository** down to your machine:

   `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/matrix-movies-website-hacktoberfest.git`
   
   Remember to replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

5) **Go into your local repo directory**

   `cd matrix-movies-website-hacktoberfest`

6) **Create a branch**

   `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>`

   Think of a name for your new branch.  Your branch name can be anything, but it's better if it briefly describes the change you are making.  Replace `<your-branch-name>` with the branch name you've chosen.

7) **Edit your changes** in a code editor, such as VS Code.

8) **Preview your changes**

   `git status`

9) **Send your changes up to your forked repo at GitHub:  Add, commit and push**

   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

10) **Create a new pull request** from your forked repo at GitHub.  (Click on the green **"Compare & pull request"** button that is near the top of the page.)
