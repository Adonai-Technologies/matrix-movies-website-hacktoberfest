        <h4 class="collapsible">The Matrix (1999)</h4>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Summary of Movie 1</p>
          <p>
            The story is set in a dystopian future where humanity is unknowingly
            trapped in a simulated reality created by intelligent machines. The
            machines use humans as a power source, keeping them docile and
            unaware of the real world. This simulated reality is called "The
            Matrix."
          </p>
          <p>
            Neo, a computer hacker, becomes increasingly curious about the true
            nature of reality and the existence of a mysterious figure called
            Morpheus. Morpheus believes that Neo is "The One," a prophesied
            individual with the potential to break free from the Matrix and end
            the war between humans and machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neo meets Morpheus and his crew, including Trinity, who helps him
            escape from the Matrix. Neo undergoes rigorous training to
            understand his newfound abilities, which include bending the rules
            of the Matrix, such as defying gravity and learning martial arts at
            an accelerated rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Neo becomes more powerful, he is pitted against the Matrix's
            enigmatic antagonist, Agent Smith, who is a program designed to
            eliminate those who threaten the system. The conflict intensifies as
            Neo and his allies attempt to rescue Morpheus, who has been captured
            by the agents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, Neo confronts the Architect of the Matrix, who explains
            that he is not the first "One" and that the system allows for
            periodic rebellions as a way to maintain control. Neo chooses to
            save humanity by returning to the Matrix and defeating Agent Smith.
            In a climactic battle, Neo sacrifices himself to destroy Smith,
            temporarily restoring peace within the Matrix.
          </p>
          <p>
            The movie ends with the suggestion that the war between humans and
            machines continues, but there is hope for a better future. Neo's
            sacrifice inspires others to question the reality of the Matrix,
            setting the stage for potential change.
          </p>

        <h4 class="collapsible">The Matrix Reloaded (2003)</h4>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Summary of Movie 2</p>
          <p>
            Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus continue their quest to free humanity
            from the Matrix. They are joined by other members of the resistance,
            including Niobe and her crew.
          </p>
          <p>
            The central plot revolves around Neo's discovery that the machines
            are drilling towards Zion, the last human city, in an attempt to
            destroy it. Neo believes that he can stop this by reaching the
            Source, a machine mainframe that controls the Matrix. To do this, he
            must find the Keymaker, a program that can unlock specific doors
            within the Matrix.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neo and his allies confront the Merovingian, a rogue program, and
            his henchmen. They also face off against the deadly Twins (identical
            ghost-like agents) and Agent Smith, who is now more powerful and
            deadly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, in Zion, preparations are made to defend against the
            impending machine attack. Morpheus gives an inspiring speech to the
            citizens, and a massive battle against the machines' sentinels
            occurs within the underground city.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Neo and his team navigate the Matrix, they eventually locate the
            Keymaker. A thrilling highway chase ensues, involving multiple
            vehicles and intense combat. Neo and his allies successfully
            retrieve the Keymaker, but they lose some of their allies along the
            way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neo reaches the Source, where he encounters the Architect, a
            powerful program who reveals that the prophecy of "The One" and the
            cyclical nature of the Matrix are controlled by the machines. Neo's
            role is to return to the Source, which will lead to the temporary
            reloading of the Matrix and the continuation of the human-machine
            conflict.
          </p>
          <p>
            The movie ends with a cliffhanger as Neo chooses to save Trinity
            instead of returning to the Source, defying the Architect's
            expectations. Meanwhile, Zion faces a massive sentinel attack,
            setting the stage for the next movie, "The Matrix Revolutions."

        <div class="content">
          <p>Summary of Movie 3</p>
          <p>
            The film picks up where "The Matrix Reloaded" left off, with Neo
            trapped in a coma-like state between the Matrix and the real world
            after choosing to save Trinity rather than returning to the Source.
            In the real world, the city of Zion is under siege by the machines,
            and humanity's last stand is imminent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Morpheus, Trinity, and Seraph seek the help of the Oracle to rescue
            Neo. The Oracle reveals that Neo's path is intertwined with that of
            Agent Smith, the rogue agent who has become a virus within the
            Matrix and is threatening both the simulated world and the real
            world. She instructs them to find the Machine City and broker a
            truce with the machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Matrix, Neo awakens and demonstrates newfound abilities that
            allow him to see without his eyes and control the machines. He forms
            an alliance with the Trainman and enters the Matrix's Mobil Avenue
            station to reach the Machine City.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back in Zion, the human defenders prepare for the final assault on
            the machines. The battle between humans and machines is fierce, with
            both sides suffering heavy losses. Meanwhile, Neo encounters and
            battles an upgraded Agent Smith, and their fight within the Matrix
            escalates.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the battle rages on in both worlds, Neo and Smith's confrontation
            reaches its climax. Neo realizes that the only way to stop Smith is
            to allow him to assimilate him, as Neo is the result of a system
            anomaly. By doing so, Neo overloads Smith with his own essence,
            leading to the destruction of both Neo and Smith.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the real world, the machines, influenced by Neo's actions in the
            Matrix, stop their assault on Zion. The war comes to an end, and the
            truce between humans and machines begins. Neo's body is found and
            carried away by the machines as a sign of respect.
          </p>
          <p>
            The film ends with the Oracle and the Architect meeting in the park,
            discussing the future of the Matrix and the coexistence of humans
            and machines. The Oracle expresses her optimism for a better future,
            while the Architect remains cautious.

        <div class="content">
          <p>Summary of Movie 4</p>
          <p>
            Bugs, the captain of the Mnemosyne, encounters a program that runs
            old code related to Trinity discovering Neo's location before the
            Matrix's agents can find her. Bugs realizes that one of the agents
            is actually an embodiment of Morpheus and helps free him from this
            isolated node of the Matrix before it's erased.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Matrix, Neo is a successful game developer who created a
            trilogy of video games inspired by his dreams of the Matrix. He has
            a business partner named Smith, and he frequents a coffee shop where
            he encounters Tiffany, a married woman who reminds him of his dreams
            of Trinity. Neo struggles to differentiate between his dreams and
            reality and consults a therapist who provides him with blue pills to
            maintain his sanity. However, he eventually stops taking them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neo notices an intruder in one of his private game instances but
            later discovers that this instance has been deleted by Smith. Bugs
            and Morpheus outside the Matrix discover Neo's signal, even though
            it was believed that Neo had died. They connect Neo's signal to Neo,
            realizing that he had unconsciously been running the node that
            allowed Morpheus to be found. Bugs and her allies enter the Matrix
            to locate Neo's body in the real world and discover that Smith, who
            was previously an agent, has been closely monitoring Neo's
            activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bugs helps Neo evade Smith, who now has the ability to control
            numerous individuals within the Matrix as a swarm. They explain to
            Neo what the Matrix is, and given his already wavering perception of
            reality, he agrees to be extracted. Neo wakes up in a pod and finds
            that Trinity is in a nearby pod. Machine entities loyal to Bugs
            rescue him before he can free Trinity. They take Neo to the
            Mnemosyne and the new human sanctuary of Io.
          </p>
          <p>
            Niobe, now elderly, explains that sixty years have passed since the
            end of the Machine War, and humans have allied with the machines to
            maintain the system and combat an Anomaly within it. Neo meets Sati,
            an exile program he had encountered before, who explains that the
            Anomaly resurrected Neo and Trinity and kept them isolated. Neo
            wants to rescue Trinity, but Sati warns of potential consequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Niobe orders Neo to stay outside the Matrix, but Bugs and others
            decide to defy her orders to free Trinity. Coordinating efforts both
            inside and outside the Matrix, Neo and Bugs enter the Matrix but are
            met by Smith and other exile programs who want to restore the Matrix
            to its previous state. Bugs and her crew fight the Exiles, while Neo
            faces Smith and begins to regain his abilities to manipulate the
            Matrix's rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            After defeating Smith, they take Neo to Tiffany's repair shop.
            However, Neo's therapist appears and reveals himself as the Analyst,
            a program studying the human psyche. The Analyst created the
            resurrection pods to study Neo and Trinity but also to keep them
            from becoming close as it destabilized the Anomaly. He threatens to
            kill Trinity unless Neo returns to the Matrix.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bugs and Neo are forced to leave the Matrix when another ship loyal
            to Niobe returns to Io. Neo persuades Niobe to allow him to try to
            rescue Trinity again. Inside the Matrix, the Analyst proposes a
            challenge: if Trinity chooses to leave the Matrix, Neo can take her,
            but if she refuses, Neo must return permanently. Trinity,
            discovering her true identity, decides to leave the Matrix, leading
            to a confrontation with the Analyst.
          </p>
          <p>
            Smith intervenes temporarily, allowing Neo, Trinity, and others to
            escape. As they race to escape the controlled humans sent by the
            Analyst, Neo and Trinity jump from a skyscraper, expecting Neo to
            save them. However, Trinity has learned to fly, and they escape,
            regaining control of the Matrix.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the aftermath, Neo and Trinity confront the Analyst, warning him
            not to seize control of the Matrix again. They fly away together,
            determined to reshape the Matrix as they see fit, marking a new
            beginning for the world inside the simulation.
